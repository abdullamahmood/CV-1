#Faisal A. Mahmood


I am a highly inquisitive, analytical and driven individual aspiring to build systems that provide solutions to real-world problems.

My decision to enrol in Makers Academy, a selective and hyper-intensive coding programme, enabled me to learn the ways in which I can use tech to change the way (tech and non-tech) people interact with the world and one another.

I am looking to work with and learn from dedicated, intelligent and goal-oriented teams where I can utilise my people and strategic skills to make meaningful impact through tech and beyond tech.

## Skills

#### People / Team Work

I believe that the core of any organisation is its  people.

 It is through this belief that I have made an active effort in developing my interpersonal and relationship building i skills. Through my experience as a consultant at <b> Booz & Co. </b>, I saw the importance of relationships and communication within teams in order to create organisational change. At <b> Emotion Tracker</b>, a small tech start up, I played an instrumental role in establishing partnerships with academic and medical institutions that redirected the organisation to the resources it needs for a strategic market entry.
